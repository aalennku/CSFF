1. Please note that the feature extraction and calculation of centers are processed 
before running this code, and npy files should be copied or linked to the folder 
'features_paviau'

2. The codes are firstly wrote in jupyter notebook and then arranged into .py files. 
They are not so much standarized. I'm sorry for any confusion that caused by these codes.
Please contact me or open an issue if you have any question.

3. If these codes help in your research, we recommend you to cite the following papers:
